  "narrative":"This specification focuses on the opaqueness of Swing components and\n    how the SwingTree style engine relates to it.\n    The opaqueness flag of a component is an interesting property.\n    You might think that it merely controls whether the background of\n    the component is painted or not.\n\n    But it is actually more than that.\n\n    This flag is at the center of some important rendering optimizations in Swing.\n    If a component is reporting itself as opaque, then Swing assumes that a repaint\n    only needs to be done on that component and not on any of its ancestors.\n    This is a big deal because it means that Swing can avoid repainting a lot of\n    components in the hierarchy.\n\n    This sound relatively straightforward, but it becomes a lot more complicated together\n    with the SwingTree style API and its underlying styling engine.\n    So for example, if a component has rounded corners, and no foundational background\n    color, then it is technically not opaque.\n    Leaving it opaque will cause strange rendering artifacts, due to the parent component\n    not being repainted.\n\n    In this specification we will explore the different scenarios and how the SwingTree\n    style engine deals with them.",
