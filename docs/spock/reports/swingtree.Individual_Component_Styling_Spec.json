Take a look:\n\n            <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/globaltcad/swing-tree/main/src/test/resources/snapshots/components/pre-transitioning-label_2_.png\" alt=\"/snapshots/components/pre-transitioning-label_2_.png\" style=\"max-width: 50%;\" />\n\n            Except for the text it is almost completely unrecongnizable from the previous image, \n            right? :)\n        "]

        {"kind":"where","text":"\n            We are using a set of raw Swing components as well as SwingTree native components\n            together with a variety of colors.\n\n            Note that some of the lines looks very strange, \n            they expect the component to return a fully transparent background\n            color, after a normal color was specified in the style API.\n            But this is not an error, it is completely intentionally by design!\n\n            So as you may have noticed, \n            the SwingTree native components all report the \"wrong\" color.\n\n            To understand what is going on here, you have to know that when a component is\n            flagged to be opaque, then every Swing look and feel will, before painting\n            anything else, first fill out the entire background of the component with\n            the background color of the component.\n            It does this to ensure that rendering artefacts from the parent\n            are overridden.\n\n            Now this is a problem when you have the background layer of your SwingTree component\n            styled using various things like gradients, shadows, images, etc.\n            This is because SwingTree cannot hijack the internals of the ComponentUI,\n            it can however do some painting before the ComponentUI\n            through an overridden `paint(Graphics2D)` method!\n\n            Now, we could simply set the opaque flag to false to prevent the ComponentUI\n            from filling the component bounds,\n            but then we would lose the\n            performance benefits of having the opaque flag set to true (avoiding the\n            traversal repaint of parent components, and their parent components, etc).\n\n            The style configuration of this particular component\n            leads to an opaque panel, and we also have the ability to render\n            the background of the component ourselves due to the\n            component being a SwingTree component (it has the paint method overridden).\n\n            So what we do here is we set the background color of the component to\n            UI.Color.UNDEFINED, which is a special color that is actually fully transparent.\n\n            This way, when the Swing look and feel tries to paint the background of the\n            component, it will actually paint nothing, and we can do the background\n            painting ourselves in the paint method of the component.\n\n        ","code":{"component":["new JButton()","new JTextArea()","new JTextField()","new JSpinner()","new JPanel()","new JSlider()","new JProgressBar()","new JTabbedPane()","new UI.Button()","new UI.TextArea()","new UI.TextField()","new UI.Panel()","new JBox()","new JSplitButton()","new UI.Spinner()","new UI.Slider()","new UI.ProgressBar()","new UI.TabbedPane()"],"color":["Color.RED","Color.GREEN","Color.BLUE","Color.MAGENTA","Color.YELLOW","Color.CYAN","Color.ORANGE","Color.BLACK","Color.RED","Color.GREEN","Color.BLUE","Color.YELLOW","Color.ORANGE","Color.WHITE","Color.MAGENTA","Color.CYAN","Color.ORANGE","Color.BLACK"],"expected":["Color.RED","Color.GREEN","Color.BLUE","Color.MAGENTA","Color.YELLOW","Color.CYAN","Color.ORANGE","Color.BLACK","new Color(0,0,0,0)","new Color(0,0,0,0)","new Color(0,0,0,0)","new Color(0,0,0,0)","new Color(0,0,0,0)","new Color(0,0,0,0)","new Color(0,0,0,0)","Color.CYAN","Color.ORANGE","Color.BLACK"]}}
