  "narrative":"In SwingTree there are various kinds of\n    button based widget types. All of these\n    button types can have different kinds of icons\n    for different parts of a user interaction:\n\n    - A standard icon for most situation.\n    - An on rollover / hover icon for when the mouse\n      cursor moves over the button type.\n    - A on press icon, which is shown when the user\n      presses the button.\n    - An icon shown when the component is disabled\n    - An icon shown when the component is selected\n    - An icon shown when the component is selected AND disabled\n    - An icon shown when the component is selected AND being hovered over\n\n    In this specification we show you all of the methods\n    for specifying these icons and ensure that they wor as intended.",
