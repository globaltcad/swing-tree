SwingTree does not have a CSS parser.  \n    It does, however, have something better, which is similar to CSS.\n    An API for configuring styles in a declarative and type-safe way.\n\n    The main class for creating style sheets is the `StyleSheet` class,\n    an abstract class that you can extend to create your own styles like so:\n    ```java\n        class MyStyleSheet {\n           @Override\n           protected void configure() {\n                add(id(\"some unique id!\"), it -> it\n                    .borderRadius(3)\n                );\n                add(type(JPanel.class), it -> it\n                   .borderColor(Color.GREEN)\n                );\n                add(type(JButton.class), it -> it\n                    .borderWidth(7)\n                );\n            }\n        }\n    ```\n    You can then easily apply this style sheet to you SwingTree views like so:\n    ```java\n        UI.use(new MyStyleSheet(), () -> new MyView());\n    ```\n    The style sheet will be applied to all UI components created within the scope of the `use` method."},"swingtree.styles.Styles_Spec":{"executedFeatures":["Style objects are value based (with

SwingTree does not have a CSS parser.  \n    It does, however, have something better, which is similar to CSS.\n    An API for configuring styles in a declarative and type-safe way.\n\n    The main class for creating style sheets is the `StyleSheet` class,\n    an abstract class that you can extend to create your own styles like so:\n    ```java\n        class MyStyleSheet {\n           @Override\n           protected void configure() {\n                add(id(\"some unique id!\"), it -> it\n                    .borderRadius(3)\n                );\n                add(type(JPanel.class), it -> it\n                   .borderColor(Color.GREEN)\n                );\n                add(type(JButton.class), it -> it\n                    .borderWidth(7)\n                );\n            }\n        }\n    ```\n    You can then easily apply this style sheet to you SwingTree views like so:\n    ```java\n        UI.use(new MyStyleSheet(), () -> new MyView());\n    ```\n    The style sheet will be applied to all UI components created within the scope of the `use` method."},"swingtree.styles.Styles_Spec":{"executedFeatures":["Style objects are value based (with

resolution displays with higher pixel density \n    (measured in pixels per inch (PPI) or dots per inch (DPI)) have become the norm.  \n    This is especially true for mobile devices, but it is also true for desktop displays.  \n    \n    Vanilla Swing does not handle this well unfortunately, even with the introduction of\n    the HiDPI support in Java 9, which allows us to determine the DPI of the display.\n    Because although we calculate the scaling factor, there is no way to apply it to the UI.\n    Instead the task is left to the Look and Feel implementations which may or may not\n    scale the UI.\n    The problem is that older Look and Feels do not scale the UI, and even newer ones\n    may not scale the UI at all. \n    In fact none of the Look and Feels included in the JDK scale the UI.\n    \n    SwingTree can hardly solve this problem entirely, but it can help by scaling the UI\n    where the Look and Feel does not.\n    In this specification you will find out how to adjust the SwingTree scaling factor\n    and how it affects the properties of the UI components."},"swingtree.scrollpane.Scroll_Pane_Spec":{"executedFeatures":["Configure both the horizontal and
