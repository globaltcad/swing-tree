and statement nesting to facilitate the creation of a GUI tree.\n    This is a common pattern in many libraries, and is often referred to as a\n    Builder pattern, which is ruffly the what SwingTree consists of.\n    \n    But you may be surprised to hear that one SwingTree builder\n    is not like the other. There are actually three different\n    builder modes! Although they all look the same and their declarations\n    will lead to the creation of the same GUI tree, they differ in terms\n    of their purpose and how they ought not to be used.\n    \n    The three modes are:\n\n    * Declarative Only Factory Builder Mode\n    * Declarative Only Builder Mode\n    * Free Builder Mode\n    \n    Sounds confusing! So let's break it down.\n    \n    The first two modes are declarative only, which means that the\n    methods designed for chaining first dispose of the current builder and\n    then return a new instance of the builder. This disposed builder\n    is then disabled and can no longer be used to build the GUI tree.\n    This is done to prevent the builder from being used in any other way\n    than for building the GUI tree declaratively.\n    \n    The difference between the two declarative modes is that the\n    factory builder mode behaves very similar to the stream API\n    in that all of the operations defined by the chain of method \n    calls are composed into a single function that is executed\n    when the component is being accessed. \n    Every time the component is accessed, a new component is created\n    and then sent through the chain of build operations.\n    Most builders in SwingTree are factory builders, \n    given that they are not created with a component instance\n    passed to their constructor.\n    \n    The last mode is the free builder mode, which is the most unrestricted\n    of the three modes. It is spanned when switching to procedural\n    code using the various `apply` methods on the builder.\n    Make sure not to overuse this mode, as writing\n    GUI code procedurally is usually messier than declarative design.\n    \n    If this is still confusing, don't worry.\n    The following examples will make it clear \n    where each mode is used and how they differ.\n    \n    You actually do not need to know about the different modes\n    to use SwingTree, but it is good to know about them\n    to understand the design of the library."},"swingtree.Button_Binding_Spec":{"executedFeatures":["A button group will not only synchronize the selection state of radio buttons, but also bound properties.","Bind the \"isSelected\"

any of its ancestors.\n    This is a big deal because it means that Swing can avoid repainting a lot of\n    components in the hierarchy.\n    \n    This sound relatively straightforward, but it becomes a lot more complicated together\n    with the SwingTree style API and its underlying styling engine.\n    So for example, if a component has rounded corners, and no foundational background\n    color, then it is technically not opaque.\n    Leaving it opaque will cause strange rendering artifacts, due to the parent component\n    not being repainted.\n    \n    In this specification we will

Scaling","narrative":"Higher resolution displays with higher pixel density \n    (measured in pixels per inch (PPI) or dots per inch (DPI)) have become the norm.  \n    This is especially true for mobile devices, but it is also true for desktop displays.  \n    \n    Vanilla Swing does not handle this well unfortunately, even with the introduction of\n    the HiDPI support in Java 9, which allows us to determine the DPI of the display.\n    Because although we calculate the scaling factor, there is no way to apply it to the UI.\n    Instead the task is left to the Look and Feel implementations which may or may not\n    scale the UI.\n    The problem is that older Look and Feels do not scale the UI, and even newer ones\n    may not scale the UI at all. \n    In fact none of the Look and Feels included in the JDK scale the UI.\n    \n    SwingTree can hardly solve this problem entirely, but it can help by scaling the UI\n    where the Look and Feel does not.\n    In this specification you will find out how to adjust the SwingTree scaling factor\n    and how it affects the properties of the UI components."},"swingtree.UI_Updates_Spec":{"executedFeatures":["We can
