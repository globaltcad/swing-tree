     *  (also see {@link #withLayout(LC, AC, AC)}) &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
     *  A typical usage pattern would be like so: &lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     *    UI.of(new MyCustomPanel())
     *    .withLayout(&quot;wrap 2&quot;, &quot;[]6[]&quot;, &quot;[]8[]&quot;);

     *    .add( UI.textField() )
     *    .add(...)
     *    ...
     *  }&lt;/pre&gt;
     *  In this example a new {@link MigLayout} is created which
     *  will wrap the components in the layout grid after 2 columns,
     *  where the 2 columns are separated by a 6 pixel gap and the rows
     *  are separated by an 8 pixel gap. &lt;br&gt;
     *  &lt;br&gt;

     *  when a component is hidden, it will not take up any space and the gaps around it will
     *  be collapsed. &lt;br&gt;
     *  Here an overview of the available hidemode values:
     *  &lt;ul&gt;
     *      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;0:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     *         Invisible components will be handled exactly as if they were visible.
     *      &lt;/li&gt;
     *      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     *          The size of the component (if invisible) will be set to 0, 0.
     *      &lt;/li&gt;
     *      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2 (SwingTree default):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     *          The size of the component (if invisible) will be set to 0, 0 and the gaps
     *          will also be set to 0 around it.
     *      &lt;/li&gt;
     *      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     *          Invisible components will not participate in the layout at all and it will
     *          for instance not take up a grid cell.
     *      &lt;/li&gt;
     * &lt;/ul&gt;
