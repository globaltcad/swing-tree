/**
 * This class models the state of an individual table/tree/list/drop down cell alongside
 * various properties that a cell should have, like for example
 * the value of the cell, its position within the component
 * as well as a {@link CellConf#view()} (renderer/editor) in the form of an AWT {@link Component}
 * which may or may not be replaced or modified.
 * &lt;br&gt;
 * The {@link CellConf} is exposed to the {@link RenderAs#as(Configurator)}
 * method after a {@link CellBuilder#when(Class)} call as part of various
 * cell builder APIs like: &lt;br&gt;
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;{@link UIForTable#withCell(Configurator)}&lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;{@link UIForTable#withCells(Configurator)}&lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;{@link UIForTable#withCellForColumn(String, Configurator)} &lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;{@link UIForTable#withCellsForColumn(String, Configurator)} &lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;{@link UIForTable#withCellForColumn(int, Configurator)} &lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;{@link UIForTable#withCellsForColumn(int, Configurator)} &lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;{@link UIForList#withCell(Configurator)} &lt;/li&gt;
 *     &lt;li&gt;{@link UIForList#withCells(Configurator)} &lt;/li&gt;
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * When configuring your cell, you may use methods like
 * {@link CellConf#view(Component)} or {@link CellConf#renderer(Size,Consumer)}
 * to define how the cell should be rendered.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note that the {@link CellConf#isEditing()} flag determines
 * two important modes in which this class is exposed to {@link RenderAs#as(Configurator)}.
 * If the {@code isEditing()} is true, then you are expected to configure a
 * cell editor component for the {@link CellConf#view()} property.
 * If the {@code isEditing()} is false, then you are expected to configure a simple
 * cell renderer component as the {@link CellConf#view()} property.&lt;br&gt;
 * Note that for each state of the {@code isEditing()} flag, the view component
 * is persisted across multiple calls to the {@link RenderAs#as(Configurator)} method.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This design allows you to easily define and continuously update both a
 * renderer and an editor for a cell on a single call to the {@link RenderAs#as(Configurator)} method, and then
 * to update the renderer or editor in every subsequent call to the same method.
 *
 * @param &lt;V&gt; The entry type of the entry of this {@link CellConf}.
