/**
 * 	One of Swing's biggest drawbacks is that it is single threaded. This means that all
 * 	GUI events are processed on the same thread as the application logic.
 * 	This is... &lt;br&gt;
 * 	&lt;ul&gt;
 * 		&lt;li&gt; not very efficient
 * 		&lt;li&gt; not very responsive
 * 		&lt;li&gt; not very scalable
 * 		&lt;li&gt; not very testable
 * 		&lt;li&gt; not very maintainable
 * 		&lt;li&gt; not very extensible
 * 		&lt;li&gt; not very ... (you get the idea)
 * 	&lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * 	Swing-Tree fixes this mess by decoupling the GUI from the application by delegating
 * 	the GUI events to a separate thread.
 * 	This is done through implementations of this {@link EventProcessor} interface.
 * 	By default, Swing-Tree uses a {@link DecoupledEventProcessor} which simply uses the
 * 	executes the GUI events immediately on the GUI thread.
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	If you want to do proper decoupling, you can switch to the decoupled event processor like so: &lt;br&gt;
 * 	&lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * 	use(EventProcessor.DECOUPLED, ()-&gt;
 *      UI.panel(&quot;fill&quot;)
 *      .add( &quot;shrink&quot;, UI.label( &quot;Username:&quot; ) )
 *      .add( &quot;grow, pushx&quot;, UI.textField(&quot;User1234..42&quot;) )
 *      .add( label( &quot;Password:&quot; ) )
 *      .add( &quot;grow, pushx&quot;, UI.passwordField(&quot;child-birthday&quot;) )
 *      .add( &quot;span&quot;,
 *          UI.button(&quot;Login!&quot;).onClick( it -&gt; {...} )
 *      )
 *  );
 *  }&lt;/pre&gt;
