/**
 *  Defines an animation in terms of functional transformations
 *  taking in an {@link AnimationStatus} together with a value
 *  and returning an updated value. &lt;br&gt;
 *  The value is expected to be immutable and may be everything
 *  from a simple {@link java.lang.Number} to a complex view model
 *  holding your application state and business logic. &lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  Implementations of this are designed to be used as
 *  part of the {@link Animatable} class holding the initial
 *  animation state and the {@link LifeTime} determining
 *  when the animation should run.&lt;br&gt;
 *  So you may use this interface to define an {@link Animatable}
 *  like this: &lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *      return Animatable.of(
 *          LifeTime.of(0.45, TimeUnit.SECONDS), this,
 *          (status, model) -&gt; model.withFontSize((int) (24 + status.pulse() * 16))
 *      );
 *  }
 *  &lt;/pre&gt;
 *  An {@link Animatable} may then be passed to
 *  {@link swingtree.UI#animate(sprouts.Var, Animatable)} together
 *  with a {@link sprouts.Var} property to repeatedly transform
 *  the property item during the iterations of the entire animation lifetime.
 *
 * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of the value that is animated
 *           through repeated transformations.
