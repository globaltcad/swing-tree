/**
 *  An API for creating an {@link Animation} and defining how it should be executed.
 *  Instances of this class are intended to be created and used either by the
 *  {@link swingtree.UI} API or the user event delegation API (see {@link ComponentDelegate}). &lt;br&gt;
 *  The UI API can be used like so:
 *  &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *    UI.schedule( 100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS ) // returns an Animate instance
 *       .until( it -&gt; it.progress() &gt;= 0.75 &amp;&amp; someOtherCondition() )
 *       .go( state -&gt; {
 *          // do something
 *          someComponent.setValue( it.progress() );
 *          // ...
 *          someComponent.repaint();
 *       });
 *   }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *   The user event delegation API can be used like this:
 *   &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *       panel()
 *       .onMouseClick( it -&gt; {
 *           it.animateFor( 100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS )
 *           .goOnce( state -&gt; {
 *               int width = (int) (100 * state.progress());
 *               it.getComponent().setSize( width, 100 );
 *           });
 *       })
 *   }&lt;/pre&gt;
