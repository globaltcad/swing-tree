/**
 *  A functional interface for doing custom painting on a component
 *  using the {@link Graphics2D} API.
 *  This is typically used to paint &lt;b&gt;custom styles on components&lt;/b&gt; as part of the style API
 *  exposed by {@link swingtree.UIForAnySwing#withStyle(Styler)}, like so:
 *  &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *  UI.label(&quot;I am a label&quot;)
 *  .withStyle( it -&gt; it
 *    .size(120, 50)
 *    .padding(6)
 *    .painter(UI.Layer.BACKGROUND, g -&gt; {
 *      g.setColor(Color.ORANGE);
 *      var e = new Ellipse2D.Double(5,5,25,25);
 *      g.fill(UI.scale(e);
 *    })
 *    .fontSize(12)
 *  )
 *  }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *  Which is based on the {@link swingtree.style.ComponentStyleDelegate#painter(UI.Layer, Painter)}.
 *  You may also want to take a look at &lt;br&gt;
 *  {@link swingtree.style.ComponentStyleDelegate#painter(UI.Layer, UI.ComponentArea, Painter)}, &lt;br&gt;
 *  {@link swingtree.style.ComponentStyleDelegate#painter(UI.Layer, String, Painter)} and &lt;br&gt;
 *  {@link swingtree.style.ComponentStyleDelegate#painter(UI.Layer, UI.ComponentArea, String, Painter)}. &lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;br&gt;
 *  You can also use painter implementations
 *  for &lt;b&gt;defining custom component event based animations&lt;/b&gt; by registering through the
 *  {@link swingtree.ComponentDelegate#paint(AnimationStatus, Painter)} method
 *  inside of an {@link Animation} registered through
 *  {@link swingtree.ComponentDelegate#animateFor(double, TimeUnit, Animation)}.
 *  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 *  Note that inside the painter the {@link Graphics2D} context may not
 *  be scaled according to the current UI scale factor (for high DPI displays). &lt;br&gt;
 *  Check out the following methods for scaling your paint operations: &lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;ul&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt;{@link UI#scale()} - returns the current UI scale factor.&lt;/li&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt;{@link UI#scale(Graphics2D)} - scales the given graphics context according to the current UI scale factor.&lt;/li&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt;{@link UI#scale(double)} - scales the given value according to the current UI scale factor.&lt;/li&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt;{@link UI#scale(float)} - scales the given value according to the current UI scale factor.&lt;/li&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt;{@link UI#scale(int)} - scales the given value according to the current UI scale factor.&lt;/li&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt;{@link UI#scale(Insets)} - scales the given insets according to the current UI scale factor.&lt;/li&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt;{@link UI#scale(Dimension)} - scales the given dimension according to the current UI scale factor.&lt;/li&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt;{@link UI#scale(Rectangle)} - scales the given rectangle according to the current UI scale factor.&lt;/li&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt;{@link UI#scale(RoundRectangle2D)} - scales the given round rectangle according to the current UI scale factor.&lt;/li&gt;
 *      &lt;li&gt;{@link UI#scale(java.awt.geom.Ellipse2D)} - scales the given ellipse according to the current UI scale factor.&lt;/li&gt;
 *  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;br&gt;
 *  Note that your custom painters will yield the best performance if they are stateless and immutable
 *  as well has if they have a good {@link Object#hashCode()} and {@link Object#equals(Object)} implementation.
 *  This is because it allows SwingTree to cache the rendering of the painters and avoid unnecessary repaints. &lt;br&gt;
 *  &lt;b&gt;If you do not want to create a custom class just for painting but instead
 *  just want to pass an immutable cache key to a painter, then consider using the
 *  {@link #of(Object, Painter)} factory method to create a painter that has the
 *  with {@link Object#hashCode()} and {@link Object#equals(Object)} implemented as a delegate to the data object.&lt;/b&gt;
 *  &lt;p&gt;
 *  &lt;b&gt;Also consider taking a look at the &lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://globaltcad.github.io/swing-tree/&quot;&gt;living swing-tree documentation&lt;/a&gt;
 *  where you can browse a large collection of examples demonstrating how to use the API of Swing-Tree in general.&lt;/b&gt;
