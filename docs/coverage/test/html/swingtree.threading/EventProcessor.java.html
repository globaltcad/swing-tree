/**
 * 	One of Swing's biggest drawback is that it is single threaded. This means that all
 * 	GUI events are processed on the same thread as the application logic. &lt;br&gt;
 * 	This is problematic for several reasons:
 * 	&lt;ul&gt;
 * 		&lt;li&gt; The GUI is not responsive while the application logic is running.
 * 			 For example, if you have a long running task, the GUI will not be updated
 * 			 until the task is finished.
 * 		&lt;li&gt; The GUI is not thread safe. If you try to update the GUI from a different thread
 * 			 than the GUI thread, you will get an exception.
 * 		&lt;li&gt; The GUI is not decoupled from the application logic. This means that the GUI
 * 			 is tightly coupled to the application logic, which makes it hard to test the GUI.
 * 		&lt;li&gt; Using your GUI thread not only for GUI events and rendering but also for application logic,
 * 	         will reduce the performance of your application.
 * 	&lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * 	Swing-Tree fixes this mess by decoupling the GUI from the application by delegating
 * 	the GUI events to a separate thread.
 * 	This is done through implementations of this {@link EventProcessor} interface.
 * 	&lt;p&gt;
 * 	If you want to do proper decoupling, you can switch to the decoupled event processor like so: &lt;br&gt;
 * 	&lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * 	use(EventProcessor.DECOUPLED, ()-&gt;
 *      UI.panel(&quot;fill&quot;)
 *      .add( &quot;shrink&quot;, UI.label( &quot;Username:&quot; ) )
 *      .add( &quot;grow, pushx&quot;, UI.textField(&quot;User1234..42&quot;) )
 *      .add( label( &quot;Password:&quot; ) )
 *      .add( &quot;grow, pushx&quot;, UI.passwordField(&quot;child-birthday&quot;) )
 *      .add( &quot;span&quot;,
 *          UI.button(&quot;Login!&quot;).onClick( it -&gt; {...} )
 *      )
 *  );
 *  }&lt;/pre&gt;
 * 	Note that by default, Swing-Tree uses a simple event processor which does not delegate GUI events to a separate thread.
 * 	So if you want to activate this powerful feature you have to change the event processor. &lt;br&gt;
 * 	See {@link EventProcessor#COUPLED}, {@link EventProcessor#COUPLED_STRICT} and {@link EventProcessor#DECOUPLED}.
